# 2048-Game
This is another game I made during the senior year of high school.

The program was made using Java on the Greenfoot IDE.

This game works almost exactly like every other 2048 game out there, just a lot more primative since this is something I made as a side final project.
I dont have the compiled version of this since I dont have greenfoot on my current setup so the compiled executable Jar file is not on here.
